## Editing

Dante is already optimised for adding, updating and removing pages, and components within CloudCannon.

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The **Author Staff Member** field links to members in the **Staff Members** collection.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Forms

* The contact form isn't connected to any backend allowing you connect to your provider of choice. As this template is configured for CloudCannon we would reccomend using CloudCannon as your contact form provider. Documentation can be found here: https://cloudcannon.com/documentation/articles/creating-a-form-for-your-site-on-cloudcannon/ 

### Staff Members

### Footer
